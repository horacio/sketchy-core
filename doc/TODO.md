# To do

Several improvements that should be made to Sketchy in the near future are listed here:

* Move agent communication to a stream processing framework such as [Samza](http://samza.incubator.apache.org/) or [Storm](http://storm-project.net/)
* Build more ingester types to generalize to a wider variety of messaging infrastructures
* Incorporate a community-built tokenizer that supports major languages including those with [logographic characters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logogram) (unfortunately SoundCloud cannot contribute this)

Consider contributing code to Sketchy! Feel free to contact the [Trust, Safety & Security Team](mailto:sketchy@soundcloud.com).
