# To do

Several improvements that can be made to Sketchy are as follows:

* Move agent communication to a stream-processing framework such as [Samza](http://samza.incubator.apache.org/) or [Storm](http://storm-project.net/).
* Build more ingester types to generalize to a wider variety of messaging infrastructures.
* Incorporate a community-built tokenizer that supports major languages, including languages with [logographic characters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logogram).
